# How to create an echo bot

[!INCLUDE[applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)]

_start with the echo bot template, build and test it, look at the code: provisioning, endpoint, adapter._

## Bot templates

In the following sections, we examine _key pieces_ of an EchoBot that you can easily create using the templates provided for [**CSharp**](../dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-sdk-quickstart.md) or [**JavaScript**](../javascript/bot-builder-javascript-quickstart.md) or [**Python**](../python/bot-builder-python-quickstart.md).

<!--Need to add section calling out the controller in code, and explaining it further-->

A bot is a web application, and templates are provided for each language.

[!INCLUDE [VSIX templates](~/includes/vsix-templates-versions.md)]

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

The VSIX template generates a [ASP.NET MVC Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc) web app. If you look at the [ASP.NET](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/index?view=aspnetcore-3.1&preserve-view=true) fundamentals, you'll see similar code in files such as **Program.cs** and **Startup.cs**. These files are required for all web apps and are not bot specific.

### appsettings.json file

The **appsettings.json** file specifies the configuration information for your bot, such as the app ID, and password among other things. If using certain technologies or using this bot in production, you will need to add your specific keys or URL to this configuration. For this Echo bot, however, you don't need to do anything here right now; the app ID and password may be left undefined at this time.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

<!-- TODO: Update this aka link to point to samples/javascript_nodejs/02.echobot (instead of samples/javascript_nodejs/02.a.echobot) once work-in-progress is merged into master. -->

The Yeoman generator creates a type of [restify](http://restify.com/) web application. If you look at the restify quickstart in their docs, you'll see an app similar to the generated **index.js** file. We describe some of the key files generated by the template. Code in some files won't be copied, but you will see it when you run the bot, and you can refer to the [Node.js echobot](https://aka.ms/js-echobot-sample) sample.

### package.json

**package.json** specifies dependencies and their associated versions for your bot. This is all set up by the template and your system.

### .env file

The **.env** file specifies the configuration information for your bot, such as the port number, app ID, and password among other things. If using certain technologies or using this bot in production, you will need to add your specific keys or URL to this configuration. For this Echo bot, however, you don't need to do anything here right now; the app ID and password may be left undefined at this time.

To use the **.env** configuration file, the template needs an extra package included.  First, get the `dotenv` package from npm:

`npm install dotenv`

# [Python](#tab/python)

### requirements.txt

**requirements.txt** specifies dependencies and their associated versions for your bot.  This is all setup by the template and your system.

Dependencies should be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### config.py

The **config.py** file specifies the configuration information for your bot, such as the port number, app ID, and password among other things. If using certain technologies or using this bot in production, you will need to add your specific keys or URL to this configuration. For this Echo bot, however, you don't need to do anything here right now; the app ID and password may be left undefined at this time.

### Access the bot from your app

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

#### Set up services

The `ConfigureServices` method in the `Startup.cs` file loads the connected services, as well as their keys from `appsettings.json` or Azure Key Vault (if there are any), connects state, and so on. Here, we're adding MVC and setting the compatibility version on our services, then setting up the adapter and bot to be available through dependency injection to the bot controller.

<!-- want to explain the singleton vs transient here?-->

```csharp
// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_1);

    // Create the credential provider to be used with the Bot Framework Adapter.
    services.AddSingleton<ICredentialProvider, ConfigurationCredentialProvider>();

    // Create the Bot Framework Adapter.
    services.AddSingleton<IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter, BotFrameworkHttpAdapter>();

    // Create the bot as a transient. In this case the ASP Controller is expecting an IBot.
    services.AddTransient<IBot, EchoBot>();
}
```

The `Configure` method finishes the configuration of your app by specifying that the app use MVC and a few other files. All bots using the Bot Framework will need that configuration call, however that will already be defined in samples or the VSIX template when you build your bot. `ConfigureServices` and `Configure` are called by the runtime when the app starts.

#### Bot Controller

The controller, following the standard MVC structure, lets you determine the routing of messages and HTTP POST requests. For our bot, we pass the incoming request on to the adapter's *process async activity* method as explained in the [activity processing stack](#the-activity-processing-stack) section above. In that call, we specify the bot and any other authorization information that may be required.

The controller implements `ControllerBase`, holds the adapter and bot that we set in `Startup.cs` (that are available here through dependency injection), and passes the necessary information on to the bot when it receives an incoming HTTP POST.

Here, you'll see the class proceeded by route and controller attributes. These assist the framework to route the messages appropriately and know which controller to use. If you change the value in the route attribute, that changes the endpoint the emulator or other channels use access your bot.

```cs
// This ASP Controller is created to handle a request. Dependency Injection will provide the Adapter and IBot
// implementation at runtime. Multiple different IBot implementations running at different endpoints can be
// achieved by specifying a more specific type for the bot constructor argument.
[Route("api/messages")]
[ApiController]
public class BotController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter Adapter;
    private readonly IBot Bot;

    public BotController(IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter adapter, IBot bot)
    {
        Adapter = adapter;
        Bot = bot;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task PostAsync()
    {
        // Delegate the processing of the HTTP POST to the adapter.
        // The adapter will invoke the bot.
        await Adapter.ProcessAsync(Request, Response, Bot);
    }
}
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

#### index.js

The `index.js` sets up your bot and the hosting service that will forward activities to your bot logic.

#### Required libraries

At the very top of your `index.js` file you will find a series of modules or libraries that are being required. These modules will give you access to a set of functions that you may want to include in your application.

```javascript
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
const path = require('path');
const restify = require('restify');

// Import required bot services.
// See https://aka.ms/bot-services to learn more about the different parts of a bot.
const { BotFrameworkAdapter } = require('botbuilder');

// This bot's main dialog.
const { MyBot } = require('./bot');

// Import required bot configuration.
const ENV_FILE = path.join(__dirname, '.env');
dotenv.config({ path: ENV_FILE });
```

#### Set up services

The next parts set up the server and adapter that allow your bot to communicate with the user and send responses. The server will listen on the specified port from the configuration file, or fall back to _3978_ for connection with your emulator. The adapter will act as the conductor for your bot, directing incoming and outgoing communication, authentication, and so on.

```javascript
// Create HTTP server
const server = restify.createServer();
server.listen(process.env.port || process.env.PORT || 3978, () => {
    console.log(`\n${ server.name } listening to ${ server.url }`);
    console.log(`\nGet Bot Framework Emulator: https://aka.ms/bot-framework-www-portal-emulator`);
    console.log(`\nTo talk to your bot, open the emulator select "Open Bot"`);
});

// Create adapter.
// See https://aka.ms/about-bot-adapter to learn more about how bots work.
const adapter = new BotFrameworkAdapter({
    appId: process.env.MicrosoftAppId,
    appPassword: process.env.MicrosoftAppPassword
});

// Catch-all for errors.
adapter.onTurnError = async (context, error) => {
    // This check writes out errors to console log .vs. app insights.
    console.error(`\n [onTurnError]: ${ error }`);
    // Send a message to the user
    await context.sendActivity(`Oops. Something went wrong!`);
};

// Create the main dialog.
const myBot = new MyBot();
```

#### Forwarding requests to the bot logic

The adapter's `processActivity` sends incoming activities to the bot logic.
The third parameter within `processActivity` is a function handler that will be called to perform the bot's logic after the received [activity](#the-activity-processing-stack) has been pre-processed by the adapter and routed through any middleware. The turn context variable, passed as an argument to the function handler, can be used to provide information about the incoming activity, the sender and receiver, the channel, the conversation, etc. Activity processing is routed to the bot's `run` method. `run` is defined in `ActivityHandler`; it performs some error checking, and then calls the bot's event handlers based on the type of activity received.

```javascript
// Listen for incoming requests.
server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
    adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (context) => {
        // Route to main dialog.
        await myBot.run(context);
    });
});
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

#### app.py

The `app.py` sets up your bot and the hosting service that will forward activities to your bot logic.

#### Required libraries

At the very top of your `app.py` file you will find a series of modules or libraries that are being required. These modules will give you access to a set of functions that you may want to include in your application.

```py
from botbuilder.core import BotFrameworkAdapterSettings, TurnContext, BotFrameworkAdapter
from botbuilder.schema import Activity, ActivityTypes

from bots import MyBot

# Create the loop and Flask app
LOOP = asyncio.get_event_loop()
app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)
app.config.from_object("config.DefaultConfig")
```

#### Set up services

The next parts set up the server and adapter that allow your bot to communicate with the user and send responses. The server will listen on the specified port from the configuration file, or fall back to _3978_ for connection with your emulator. The adapter will act as the conductor for your bot, directing incoming and outgoing communication, authentication, and so on.

```py
# Create adapter.
# See https://aka.ms/about-bot-adapter to learn more about how bots work.
SETTINGS = BotFrameworkAdapterSettings(app.config["APP_ID"], app.config["APP_PASSWORD"])
ADAPTER = BotFrameworkAdapter(SETTINGS)

# Catch-all for errors.
async def on_error(context: TurnContext, error: Exception):
    # This check writes out errors to console log .vs. app insights.
    # NOTE: In production environment, you should consider logging this to Azure
    #       application insights.
    print(f"\n [on_turn_error] unhandled error: {error}", file=sys.stderr)

    # Send a message to the user
    await context.send_activity("The bot encountered an error or bug.")
    await context.send_activity("To continue to run this bot, please fix the bot source code.")
    # Send a trace activity if we're talking to the Bot Framework Emulator
    if context.activity.channel_id == 'emulator':
        # Create a trace activity that contains the error object
        trace_activity = Activity(
            label="TurnError",
            name="on_turn_error Trace",
            timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
            type=ActivityTypes.trace,
            value=f"{error}",
            value_type="https://www.botframework.com/schemas/error"
        )
        # Send a trace activity, which will be displayed in Bot Framework Emulator
        await context.send_activity(trace_activity)

ADAPTER.on_turn_error = on_error

# Create the Bot
BOT = MyBot()
```

#### Forwarding requests to the bot logic

The adapter's `process_activity` sends incoming activities to the bot logic.
The third parameter within `process_activity` is a function handler that will be called to perform the bot's logic after the received [activity](#the-activity-processing-stack) has been pre-processed by the adapter and routed through any middleware. The turn context variable, passed as an argument to the function handler, can be used to provide information about the incoming activity, the sender and receiver, the channel, the conversation, etc. Activity processing is routed to the bot's `on_turn` method. `on_turn` is defined in `ActivityHandler`; it performs some error checking, and then calls the bot's event handlers based on the type of activity received.

```py
# Listen for incoming requests on /api/messages
@app.route("/api/messages", methods=["POST"])
def messages():
    # Main bot message handler.
    if "application/json" in request.headers["Content-Type"]:
        body = request.json
    else:
        return Response(status=415)

    activity = Activity().deserialize(body)
    auth_header = (
        request.headers["Authorization"] if "Authorization" in request.headers else ""
    )

    try:
        task = LOOP.create_task(
            ADAPTER.process_activity(activity, auth_header, BOT.on_turn)
        )
        LOOP.run_until_complete(task)
        return Response(status=201)
    except Exception as exception:
        raise exception
```
