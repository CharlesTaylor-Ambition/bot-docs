# How to create a basic bot project

[!INCLUDE[applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)]

All bot applications share some common features.
This article describes these features:

- Resource provisioning
- A language-specific HTTP endpoint implementation that routes incoming activities to an adapter.
- An adapter object
- A bot object

The first two features are part of the web framework you choose to use and not part of the Bot Framework SDK.
However, the Bot Framework templates and samples are written for ASP.NET (C#), Restify (JavaScript), and aiohttp (Python).

You can crate an echo bot from the templates, as described in the quickstarts ([**C#**](../dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-sdk-quickstart.md), [**JavaScript**](../javascript/bot-builder-javascript-quickstart.md), or [**Python**](../python/bot-builder-python-quickstart.md)), or you can copy an echo bot from the [Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples) repository.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of [bot basics](bot-builder-basics.md).
- A copy of the **echo bot** sample in [**C#**](https://aka.ms/cs-echobot-sample), [**JavaScript**](https://aka.ms/js-echobot-sample), or [**Python**](https://aka.ms/py-echobot-sample).

## Bot templates

A bot is a web application, and templates are provided for each language.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

The Bot Framework includes both VSIX and dotnet templates.

The templates generate an [ASP.NET MVC Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc) web app. If you look at the [ASP.NET](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/index?view=aspnetcore-3.1&preserve-view=true) fundamentals, you'll see similar code in files such as **Program.cs** and **Startup.cs**. These files are required for all web apps and are not bot specific.

[!INCLUDE [VSIX templates](~/includes/vsix-templates-versions.md)]

The **appsettings.json** file specifies the configuration information for your bot, such as its app ID, and password among other things. If using certain technologies or using this bot in production, you will need to add your specific keys or URL to this configuration. For this echo bot, however, you don't need to do anything here right now; the app ID and password may be left undefined at this time.

The **EchoBot.csproj** file specifies dependencies and their associated versions for your bot. This is all set up by the template and your system. Additional dependencies can be installed using NuGet package manager or the `dotnet add package` command.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

The Yeoman generator creates a type of [restify](http://restify.com/) web application. If you look at the restify quickstart in their docs, you'll see an app similar to the generated **index.js** file. Some of the key files generated by the template are described in this article. Code in some files won't be copied, but you will see it when you run the bot, and you can refer to the [Node.js echobot](https://aka.ms/js-echobot-sample) sample.

The **package.json** file specifies dependencies and their associated versions for your bot. This is all set up by the template and your system. Additional dependencies can be installed using `npm install`.

The **.env** file specifies the configuration information for your bot, such as the port number, app ID, and password among other things. If using certain technologies or using this bot in production, you will need to add your specific keys or URL to this configuration. For this Echo bot, however, you don't need to do anything here right now; the app ID and password may be left undefined at this time.

To use the **.env** configuration file, the bot requires the `dotenv` package from npm. This is already included as a dependency in the **package.json** file.

# [Python](#tab/python)

The Python Cookiecutter templates create an [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/) web application.

The **requirements.txt** file specifies dependencies and their associated versions for your bot.  This is all setup by the template and your system. Additional dependencies can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### config.py

The **config.py** file specifies the configuration information for your bot, such as the port number, app ID, and password among other things. If using certain technologies or using this bot in production, you will need to add your specific keys or URL to this configuration. For this Echo bot, however, you don't need to do anything here right now; the app ID and password may be left undefined at this time.

## Resource provisioning

The bot as a web app needs to create a web service and the adapter and bot objects.

It would also create the storage layer and memory management objects for the bot, but the echo bot does not require state.

### [C#](#tab/csharp)

**Startup.cs**

The `ConfigureServices` method loads the connected services, as well as their keys from **appsettings.json** or Azure Key Vault (if there are any), connects state, and so on. Here, the adapter and bot are defined to be available through dependency injection.

[!code-csharp[ConfigureServices](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/02.echo-bot/Startup.cs?range=25-35)]

The `Configure` method finishes the configuration of your app.

[!code-csharp[Configure](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/02.echo-bot/Startup.cs?range=37-56)]

`ConfigureServices` and `Configure` are called by the runtime when the app starts.

### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

In restify, you setup the web service and the objects it needs in the **index.js** file. The service, adapter, and bot are covered separately in the following sections.

### [Python](#tab/python)

In aiohttp, you setup the web service and the objects it needs in the **app.py** file. The service, adapter, and bot are covered separately in the following sections.

---

## Messaging endpoint

The template implements a web service with a messaging endpoint. The service extracts the authentication header and request payload and forwards them to the adapter.

Each incoming request represents the start of a new turn.

### [C#](#tab/csharp)

### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

**index.js**

[!code-javascript[create server](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/02.echo-bot/index.js?range=11-12,20-27,62-85)]

server.post...

server.upgrade...

### [Python](#tab/python)

<!-- Q: Why do the C# and JS echo bots support streaming, but the Python one doesn't? -->

**app.py**

[!code-python[create server](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/02.echo-bot/app.py?range=4-10,16-18,20-23,64-88)]

messages and APP.router...

---

## The adapter

The adapter receives activities from the messaging endpoint, forwards them to the bot's turn handler, and catches any errors or exceptions the bot's logic doesn't catch.

### [C#](#tab/csharp)

### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

**index.js**

[!code-javascript[create adapter](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/02.echo-bot/index.js?range=15-16,30-57)]

The `onTurnErrorHandler` function...

### [Python](#tab/python)

**app.py**

[!code-python[create adapter](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/02.echo-bot/app.py?range=11-15,22-28,30-56,58-59)]

The `on_error` function...

---

## The bot logic

The echo bot uses an _activity handler_ and implements handlers for the activity types it will recognize and react to, in this case, the _conversation update_ and _message_ activities.

### [C#](#tab/csharp)

### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

**index.js**

[!code-javascript[create bot](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/02.echo-bot/index.js?range=18-19,60)]

**bot.js**

[!code-javascript[bot logic](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/02.echo-bot/bot.js?range=4-29)]

The `onMembersAdded` handler...

The `onMessage` handler...

### [Python](#tab/python)

**app.py**

[!code-python[create bot](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/02.echo-bot/app.py?range=11-15,60-61)]

**app.py**

[!code-python[create bot](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/02.echo-bot/bots/echo_bot.py?range=4-19)]

The `on_members_added_activity` handler...

The `on_message_activity` handler...
