# Handle user and conversation events in the v3 JavaScript SDK

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](../includes/pre-release-label-v3.md)]

This article demonstrates how your bot can handle events such as a user joining a conversation, adding a bot to a contacts list, or saying **Goodbye** when a bot is being removed from a conversation.

## Greet a user on conversation join

The Bot Framework provides the [conversationUpdate][conversationUpdate] event for notifying your bot whenever a member joins or leaves a conversation. A conversation member can be a user or a bot.

The following code snippet allows the bot to greet new member(s) to a conversation or say **Goodbye** if it is being removed from the conversation.

## Acknowledge add to contacts list

The [contactRelationUpdate][contactRelationUpdate] event notifies your bot that a user has added you to their contacts list.

## Add a first-run dialog

Since the **conversationUpdate** and the **contactRelationUpdate** event are not supported by all channels, a universal way to greet a user who joins a conversation is to add a first-run dialog.

In the following example we’ve added a function that triggers the dialog any time we’ve never seen a user before. You can customize the way an action is triggered by providing an [onFindAction][onFindAction] handler for your action.

[!INCLUDE [first-run sample Node.js](../includes/snippet-code-node-first-run-dialog-1.md)]

You can also customize what an action does after its been triggered by providing an [onSelectAction][onSelectAction] handler. For trigger actions you can provide an [onInterrupted][onInterrupted] handler to intercept an interruption before it occurs. For more information, see [Handle user actions](bot-builder-nodejs-dialog-actions.md).
