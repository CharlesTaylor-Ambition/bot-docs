# Configure .NET bot for extension

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

This article describes how to update a bot to work with **named pipes**, and how to enable the Direct Line app service extension in the **Azure App Service** resource where the bot is hosted.

## Prerequisites

To perform the steps described next, you need to have a **Web App Bot**(your bot) created in Azure.

## Enable Direct Line app service extension

This section describes how to enable the Direct Line app service extension using the app service extension key from your bot's Direct Line channel configuration.

### Update bot code

> [!NOTE]
> `Microsoft.Bot.Builder.StreamingExtensions` preview packages have been deprecated. The SDK v4.8 now contains the [Streaming library](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/tree/master/libraries/Microsoft.Bot.Builder/Streaming). If a bot previously made use of the preview packages they must be removed before following the steps below.

1. In Visual Studio, open your bot project.
1. Make sure the project uses version 4.8 or higher of the Bot Builder SDK.
1. Allow your app to use the **Bot Framework NamedPipe**:
    - Open the `Startup.cs` file.
    - In the ``Configure`` method, add code to ``UseNamedPipes``

    ```csharp

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseHsts();
        }

        app.UseDefaultFiles();
        app.UseStaticFiles();

        // Allow the bot to use named pipes.
        app.UseNamedPipes(System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("APPSETTING_WEBSITE_SITE_NAME") + ".directline");

        app.UseMvc();
    }
    ```

1. Save the `Startup.cs` file.

1. **Publish** the bot to your Azure Web App Bot resource to deploy the updated code.

### Enable bot Direct Line app service extension

1. In the Azure portal, locate your **Web App Bot** resource.
1. From the left panel menu under *Bot management* click on **Channels** to configure the **Azure Bot Service** channels your bot accepts messages from.
1. If it is not already enabled, click on the **Direct Line** channel and follow instructions to enable the channel.
1. In the **Connect to channels** table click on the **Edit** link on the Direct Line row.
1. Scroll down to the **App Service Extension Keys** section.
1. Click on the **Show** link to reveal one of the keys. You will use this value in the steps below.

    ![App service extension keys](./media/channels/direct-line-extension-extension-keys.png)

1. From the left panel menu under *Application settings* section, click the **Configuration** item.
1. In the right panel, add the following new settings:

    |Name|Value|
    |---|---|
    |DirectLineExtensionKey|<App_Service_Extension_Key>|
    |DIRECTLINE_EXTENSION_VERSION|latest|

    Where the *App_Service_Extension_Key* is the value you saved earlier.

1. If your bot is hosted in a sovereign or otherwise restricted Azure cloud (i.e. you do not access Azure via the [public portal](https://portal.azure.com)) you will also need to add the following new setting:

    |Name|Value|
    |---|---|
    |DirectLineExtensionABSEndpoint|<URL_of_Direct_Line_App_Gateway>|

    Where *URL_of_Direct_Line_App_Gateway* is specific to the Azure cloud your bot is hosted in. For USGov this value is `https://directline.botframework.azure.us/v3/extension`.

1. Still within the *Configuration* section, click on the **General** settings section and turn on **Web sockets**
1. Click on **Save** to save the settings. This restarts the Azure App Service.

## Confirm Direct Line app extension and the bot are configured

In your browser, navigate to `https://<your_app_service>.azurewebsites.net/.bot`.
If everything is correct, the page will return this JSON content: `{"v":"123","k":true,"ib":true,"ob":true,"initialized":true}`. This is the information you obtain when **everything works correctly**, where

- **v** displays the build version of the Direct Line App Service Extension (ASE).
- **k** determines whether Direct Line ASE can read an App Service Extension Key from its configuration.
- **initialized** determines whether Direct Line ASE can use the App Service Extension Key to download the bot metadata from Azure Bot Service
- **ib** determines whether Direct Line ASE can establish an inbound connection with the bot.
- **ob** determines whether Direct Line ASE can establish an outbound connection with the bot.

## Troubleshooting

- If the *ib* and *ob* values displayed by the **.bot endpoint* are false this means the bot and the Direct Line app service extension are unable to connect to each other.
    1. Double check the code for using named pipes has been added to the bot.
    1. Confirm the bot is able to start up and run at all. Useful tools are **Test in WebChat**, connecting an additional channel, remote debugging, or logging.
    1. Restart the entire **Azure App Service** the bot is hosted within, to ensure a clean start up of all processes.

- If you are receiving "HTTP Error 500.34 - ANCM Mixed Hosting" it is due to your bot attempting to use the *InProcess* Hosting Model. This is remedied by explicitly setting the bot to run *OutOfProcess* instead. See [Out of Process Hosting Model.](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module?view=aspnetcore-3.1&preserve-view=true#out-of-process-hosting-model)

- If the *initialized* value of the **.bot endpoint** is false it means the Direct Line app service extension is unable to validate the **App Service Extension Key** added to the bot's *Application Settings* above.
    1. Confirm the value was correctly entered.
    1. Switch to the alternative **App Service Extension Key** shown on your bot's **Direct Line channel configuration page**.
    
- If attempting to use OAuth with the Direct Line App Service Extension and encountering the error "Unable to get the bot AppId from the audience claim." a *ClaimsIdentity* with the *AudienceClaim* assigned needs to be set on the *BotFrameworkHttpAdapter*. In order to accomplish this a developer may subclass the adapter similar to the example below:

```csharp
public class AdapterWithStaticClaimsIdentity : BotFrameworkHttpAdapter
{
 public AdapterWithStaticClaimsIdentity(IConfiguration configuration, ILogger<BotFrameworkHttpAdapter> logger, ConversationState conversationState = null)
            : base(configuration, logger)
 {
            // Manually create the ClaimsIdentity and create a Claim with a valid AudienceClaim and the AppID for a bot using the Direct Line App Service Extension.
            var appId = configuration.GetSection(MicrosoftAppCredentials.MicrosoftAppIdKey)?.Value;
            ClaimsIdentity = new ClaimsIdentity(new List<Claim>{
                new Claim(AuthenticationConstants.AudienceClaim, appId)
            });
 }
}
```
